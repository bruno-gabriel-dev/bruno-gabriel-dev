# Bruno Gabriel 👋

Software Engineering student focused on building a strong foundation in programming and creating modern, interactive web experiences.

I’m a detail-oriented person who values listening, learning and continuous improvement. I’ve always been interested in understanding how things work and solving problems, and I genuinely enjoy the process of finding solutions and seeing things come together.

Currently, I’m developing my skills in HTML, CSS and JavaScript, with a focus on clean structure, good organization and smooth interactions. My long-term goal is to become a Full Stack Developer and explore areas such as Artificial Intelligence and Game Development.

## Current focus
- Web development fundamentals (HTML, CSS, JavaScript)  
- Creating modern layouts and animations  
- Improving logic, structure and code quality  

## What you’ll find here
- Study projects  
- Practice exercises  
- Experiments and evolving ideas  

I believe in learning step by step, paying attention to details and building things with purpose.
